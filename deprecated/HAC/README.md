# Hierarchical-Actor-Critic-HAC-PyTorch

This is an implementation of the Hierarchical Actor Critic (HAC) algorithm described in the paper, [Learning Multi-Level Hierarchies with Hindsight](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.00948) (ICLR 2019), in PyTorch for OpenAI gym environments. The algorithm learns to reach a goal state by dividing the task into short horizon intermediate goals (subgoals). 



## Usage
- All the hyperparameters are contained in the `train.py` file.
- To train a new network run `train.py`
- To test a preTrained network run `test.py`

To render the environments (Mountain Car and Pendulum) with subgoals (2 or 3 level) replace the gym files in local installation directory `gym/envs/classic_control` with the files in gym folder of this repo and change the bool `render` to True



## Implementation Details

- The code is implemented as described in the appendix section of the paper and the Official repository, i.e. without target networks and with bounded Q-values.
- The Actor and Critic networks have 2 hidded layers of size 64.


## Requirements

- Python 3.6
- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)
- [OpenAI gym](https://gym.openai.com/)



## Results
